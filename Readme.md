# Event Management System (Frontend)

A frontend-only, data-driven Event Management System built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project dynamically displays college symposiums, workshops, and conferences using a separate data file, allowing easy updates **without modifying the main HTML structure**.

The application is deployed as a **static website on Netlify** and does not require any backend or database.

## 📌 Project Overview

Managing event information manually inside HTML becomes difficult as the number of events increases.  
This project solves that problem by **separating event data from the user interface**.

Event details such as:
- Event name  
- Date  
- College name  
- Location  
- Technical events  
- Non-technical events  
- Workshops  

are stored in a **separate JavaScript data file**, and the UI renders them dynamically.
